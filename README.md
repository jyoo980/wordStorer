## wordStorer: a text analysis tool ##

Developed as part of a school project, <strong>wordStorer</strong> leverages data structures such as the max/min-heap and the binary search tree to allow for fast searching for word frequency in <i>large-ish</i> text files. In addition, I have implemented search and swap algorithms to improve runtime efficency. This is a CLI application, and you can see an example of it in action below!

I have currently tested the efficency of search operations on larger text files, most recently on the entire text of Les Miserables (530,982 words).
